# Variables?
# Python variables
# Variable works as a place holder to store data
# it could be string "anything between these "  ' or this'
# integers/numbers
# Syntax to create a variable name of the variable = value of the variable
# Follow good logical naming convention

First_Name = "Prathima"
Last_Name = "Joginipelly"
#Let's create a variable to store int value
Salary = 10.5 # float value
age = 19 # int value
my_age = "22"

#print(First_Name)
#print(Last_Name)
#print(Salary)
#print(age)
#print(my_age)
# type(age) helps us to find the type of variable

#print(type(age)) # will print type of variable age
#print(type(my_age))
